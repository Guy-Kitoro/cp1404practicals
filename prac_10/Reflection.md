# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimate accuracy was initially quite poor, as I often underestimated the complexity of some tasks, especially those involving new concepts like APIs or Flask.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
As I gained more experience and better understood the typical challenges of the practical tasks, my estimates became more realistic. I started factoring in time for debugging and testing.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned the importance of breaking tasks into smaller components and estimating each part separately. Itâ€™s also clear that allowing extra time for unexpected problems is crucial.

## Practicals

### Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would introduce more real-world examples earlier in the subject, such as working with APIs, as these are highly engaging. Additionally, providing clearer explanations for some of the more complex tasks would help students.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I consistently broke down problems into smaller, manageable tasks and documented my work thoroughly. I also kept my code modular, making it easier to reuse and debug.
