## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensuring each class or function is focused on a single purpose makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Proper indentation, meaningful variable names, and comments significantly improve readability and collaboration.
- **Iterative Development:** Committing and testing small changes frequently helps avoid larger bugs and facilitates better project management.
